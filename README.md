# Noughts-and-Crosses

Two-player noughts and crosses. There is a 3x3 grid of cells.
Players take turns marking the cells with their symbol.
The first player who gets three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
If the grid is full and no player has three symbols in a row, it is a draw.
